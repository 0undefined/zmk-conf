# My zmk configuration

I have qwerty available on the master branch, and colemak-dh on its own branch.
The firmware files are unfortunately named identically, but the layouts beyond
the alphas are identical, so it should not be too hard to enter bootloader mode
and download the correct one.

* [colemak-dh downloads](https://github.com/0undefined/zmk-conf/actions?query=branch%3Acolemak-dh+is%3Acompleted)


_todo: add visualization of the layout(s)_
